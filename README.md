**Title:** Chart HTML and CSS Template

**Description:**
This repository contains an HTML and CSS template for a web page featuring a hierarchical tree structure. The template is designed for creating a visual representation of a family tree or any hierarchical information with image and text elements.

**Code Structure:**

1. The HTML structure includes:
   - `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration and the opening `<html>` tag.
   - A `<head>` section with meta tags for character set and viewport settings, a title element, and a link to an external CSS file.
   - The `<body>` section where the main content is defined.
   - A decorative SVG shape divider at the top of the page.
   - A hierarchical tree structure created using nested `<ul>` and `<li>` elements, along with anchor tags (`<a>`) that contain images and text for each node in the tree.

2. The CSS styles are defined in the `<style>` block and include:
   - Styling for the entire body of the page, including background, font, and alignment settings.
   - Styling for the hierarchical tree structure, including the positioning of list items, borders, and spacing.
   - Hover effects on tree nodes and their children, such as box shadows and background color changes.

3. External font import from Google Fonts (Poppins) is also included.

**Usage:**
This template can be used as a starting point for creating web pages that require a hierarchical tree structure with images and text. It is suitable for projects related to family trees, organizational charts, or any scenario where a visual representation of a hierarchical structure is needed.

**Contributions:**
Contributions to this repository can include improvements to the code, additional features, or bug fixes. Users are encouraged to create pull requests to enhance and customize the template according to their specific needs.

**Additional Notes:**
Ensure that any external resources (e.g., images) referenced in the HTML are available and properly linked to the repository for the template to work as expected.
